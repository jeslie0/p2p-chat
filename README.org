#+title: TCP P2P Chat in Haskell

This is an ongoing project to implement a p2p chat service in Haskell.
* Current Status
- Client.hs and Server.hs are functioning and should work.
- Main.hs is just a testing ground for the project. It should not be used.
- P2P.hs does not work as intended yet. I need to make figure out how to kill threads upon certain conditions.
* Usage
To run the server, the command is
#+begin_src bash
  ./Server PORT
#+end_src

where PORT is the port you want to host the server on.

To run the client, the command is:
#+begin_src bash
  ./Client IP-ADDRESS PORT
#+end_src

where IP-ADDRESS is the IP or URL of the server, and PORT is its port.



* Compiling
I manage to get this to work by running "cabal new-build" in the main directory, then searching about in dist-newstyle for the executables.
