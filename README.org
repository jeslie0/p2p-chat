#+title: TCP P2P Chat in Haskell

This is an ongoing project to implement a p2p chat service in Haskell.
* Current Status
- Client.hs and Server.hs are functioning and should work.
- Main.hs is just a testing ground for the project. It should not be used.
- P2P.hs does not work as intended yet. I need to make figure out how to kill threads upon certain conditions.
* Ports
The server will use the host machines ip address. The port is 1995.
* Compiling
I manage to get this to work by running "cabal build-new" in the main directory, then searching about in dist-newstyle for the executables.
